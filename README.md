# Utilities.Games
An open-source [Progressive Web Application (PWA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_application) running off of [Blazor Web Assembly (Blazor WASM)](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor). This repository holds the source for what is published to [Utilities.Games](https://utilities.games/) via GitHub Actions (see [main.yml](.github/workflows/main.yml)).

## Installing the PWA
The [Utilities.Games](https://utilities.games/) website is a Progress Web Application, which means it can be installed to the homescreen/desktop of most Android/Apple/Windows devices.

To install:
 - Navigate to [Utilities.Games](https://utilities.games/)
 - If using a smart phone, you may be prompted to "Add DotGames to Homescreen". Simply tap this option to follow the installation prompts.
 - Otherwise, go to the context menu in your browser (usually in the upper-right corner)
   - For Windows (Chromium browsers): Go to "More Tools" -> "Create Shortcut..."

# About
The web application is ultimately comprised of multiple "subsites" that each represent a specific game or franchise. Each subsite can independently maintain both raw dataset visualization as well as gameplay utilities. A gameplay utility can be anything from a level growth chart to a combat calculator.

The goal is to provide a cohesive environment for video game utilities using a shared dataset and provide a common platform for developing such utilities.

## Contribute
Contributors should be assigned to a respective subsite team and that team should be assigned to a specific subsite.

## Discussions
Everyone is encouraged to use the [Discussions](/discussions) page to recommend new subsites and utilities
