<h3>About</h3>
<p>There are a lot of "Game Guide" websites on the internet and even more calculators, spreadsheets, and abandoned projects that simplify complex game mechanics for the average user. However, these sites are scattered, incomplete, or simply no longer up-to-date.</p>
<p>Utilities.Games aims to provide an open platform for programmers to develop their useful tools, tips, and databases under one roof. This application makes it easy for programmers to help maintain the data required to provide the average user with rich, data-driven calculators and more.</p>
<p>The application runs off of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/host-and-deploy/webassembly?view=aspnetcore-6.0" target="_blank">Blazor Web Assembly</a> and is served as a <a href="https://web.dev/progressive-web-apps/" target="_blank">Progressive Web Application</a>. This is what allows you to "install" the application on your desktop or mobile device. There are many perks to this, including the ability for the application to continue to be (at least mostly) accessible even when you're not connected to the internet. However, because we (currently) do not present Ads or require a subscription, the application relies heavily on working without a server. What this means to the average user is that the application cannot (easily) access databases or other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API" target="_blank">APIs</a> and relies solely on static information that is hosted on <a href="https://github.com/Utilities-Games/Utilities.Games/" target="_blank">GitHub.com</a>.</p>
<p>As Utilities.Games is an open-source application, hosted and maintained on <a href="https://github.com/Utilities-Games/Utilities.Games/" target="_blank">GitHub.com</a>, top developers that contribute to the continued development of the application can be individually sponsored using GitHub's <a href="https://github.com/sponsors" target="_blank">GitHub Sponsors</a> program which allows consumers to show their support for the development by simply buying a developer a cup of coffee or going as far as giving them a sizable paycheck each month. Ultimately, if there is enough support from the community, it may be possible to expand the capabilities of the application to provide more interconnectivity with more games.</p>
